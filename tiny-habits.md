### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

- B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To make new habits easier:
- **Motivation (M):** Increase your desire to perform the habit.
- **Ability (A):** Make the habit easier to do.
- **Prompt (P):** Use a clear cue to remind you to perform the habit.

### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

- Celebrating after completing a habit creates a positive emotional response, reinforcing the behavior and making it more likely you'll repeat it. This positive reinforcement triggers dopamine release, solidifying the habit in your brain.
